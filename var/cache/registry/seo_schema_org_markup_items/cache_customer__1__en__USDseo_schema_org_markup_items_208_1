2-Way Audio Communication
With the TL-SC3430&rsquo;s built-in microphone or one purchased separately, users can hear what&rsquo;s happening within range of their cameras remotely.

This feature comes in handy, especially when the camera&rsquo;s IP address is always changed by users&rsquo; Internet Service Providers. Even more convenient is if the camera is connected with a router and set up in a local area network, the router&rsquo;s UPnP function can facilitate access to the camera without any complicated configuration of the router or camera.
